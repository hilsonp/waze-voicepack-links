# Waze Voicepack Links

Here is the start of a list of Waze Voicepack links. I sometimes find myself looking around for some new ones, and I'd like to organize one place where people can find what they want as well as pull request in those they enjoy themselves. 

I'll start with a table, and as this matures it will become alphabetized and organized a little better
