## Repository Objective
The vision of this repository is to have a comprehensive list of all the highest-quality community-created and no-longer-available Waze celebrity/character voice packs turned sharable links. Not all of the voice pack links below are of the highest quality; some might be missing phrases, some are only in kilometers and not miles, and some do not have the best audio quality. Your mileage may vary. If **you** have a higher quality copy of a voicepack below, or are able to share a voicepack that does not yet exist in the list below, please see the contribution instructions in `contributing.md`.

## From pipeeeeees:
As a fan of Waze navigation for many years, I've looked into ways to keep the voice packs I love the most. I've rooted/jailbroken phones, used app side loaders, and swapped mp3 files to get my favorite voices to work. I don't do that sort of stuff anymore as it is increasingly difficult, but I know some people still do. I hope this repository can serve as a place for our collective intelligence to share these voicepacks with all users!
